# Line
> A solution for long queues!

Line is a dual-app made with Expo that takes care of queue management for physical businesses. The customer's app allows clients to
locate nearby stores and join a virtual queue. The app for sellers registers the location and open hours of the stores. 

## What I've learned

This is my first mobile app, meaning that I learned how to transfer my react skills to mobile development. It introduced me to a whole
new level of UX-thinking, I had to combine practicality, minimalism and simplicity without sacrificing utility. I also learned a lot about
GeoDjango and Spacial databases, and how data indexing can affect performance and scalability.
